This repository includes my final report for the Computer Science masters degree at Boise State University.  You can find the full details in the report, but in summary I chose to conduct a literature review regarding the current state of C/C++ memory safety advances and their impact on embedded systems.  I'm a firmware engineer for my day job, so C, C++, and embedded systems and all of their associated challenges, quirks, and pain points are near and dear to my heart.

One of the most interesting things I found in the review is the amount of hardware based approaches that are being researched, especially the Cheri architecture, and except for a few sources 32 bit architectures aren't well represented in the research I reviewed.  Computer architecture is an area I wish I had the opportunity to explore more.  Who knows, maybe I'll do a PhD as a continuation of this research.
